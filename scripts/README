For the dev machine, you need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured
with credentials for your AWS account, python3, configparser and boto3.

These can be installed by runnning `sudo pip install awscli boto3 configparser`.

You will need to modify ec2config.ini with the keyname and security groups you
have setup
